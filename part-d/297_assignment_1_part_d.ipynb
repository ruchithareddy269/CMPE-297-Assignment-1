            "1. **Document Loading:** The code loads multiple policy documents from separate files.\n",
            "2. **Text Chunking:** It utilizes a text splitter to break down the lengthy documents into smaller chunks for easier processing.\n",
            "3. **Embedding Creation:** OpenAI Embeddings are used to generate vector representations of the text chunks.\n",
            "4. **Vector Store:** The FAISS vector store stores the embeddings and allows for efficient similarity search.\n",
            "5. **Gemini Chain:** A ConversationalRetrievalQAChain is defined using Gemini (gpt-4) as the LLM. It utilizes the vector store to retrieve relevant chunks for answering questions.\n",
            "6. **Comparative Analysis:** The code poses specific questions related to comparative analysis (similarities, differences, conflicts, etc.).\n",
            "7. **Output:** The script outputs Gemini's answer to each question along with the relevant source documents, providing a comprehensive analysis.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Important Considerations:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **API Keys:** Replace \"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY\" with your actual OpenAI API key.\n",
            "* **Document Format:** Ensure your policy documents are in a plain text format or can be converted to text.\n",
            "* **Question Formulation:** Clearly define your questions to guide Gemini's analysis and extract relevant insights.\n",
            "* **Model Selection:** Experiment with different Gemini models (gpt-3.5, gpt-4) to find the best fit for your needs.\n",
            "* **Contextualization:** Remember that Gemini's long context window is still limited. Break down very long documents into smaller sections for optimal analysis.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Benefits:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Efficiency:** Automates the process of analyzing large volumes of policy documents.\n",
            "* **Precision:** Provides accurate and relevant insights based on the document content.\n",
            "* **Clarity:** Presents a structured analysis with clear answers and source document references.\n",
            "* **Flexibility:** Adaptable to different types of policy documents and analysis objectives.\n",

This means the generated curriculum should be dynamic and change based on Alice's progress. For example, if she excels in a particular subject, the curriculum could recommend advanced topics or accelerate her learning pace.\n",
            "\n",
